# UnfairnessOfPopularityBias

In this repository, we are working on reproducing three studies on the topic of unfairness of popularity bias, namely Abdollahpouri et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13286), Kowald et al., [2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-45442-5_5), and Naghiaei et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13446). At the same time, we are experimenting with various aspects of the recommendation and evaluation process that vary across the three studies, specifically:

* **Data**: the studies use three datasets, with different characteristics such as size, sparsity, and distribution of item popularity.
* **Algorithms**: the studies evaluate mostly different algorithms, with some excpetions.
* **Division** of users in groups: the studies define propensity for popular items differently and divide them accordingly.
* **Evaluation** strategy: the studies make different choices in the testing process.
